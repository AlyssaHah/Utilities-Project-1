 "In software engineering, the delegation pattern is a design pattern in object-oriented programming where an object, 
 instead of performing one of its stated tasks, delegates that task to an associated helper object"
 I believe that a delegate design pattern is like having seperate classes that feed into the main class.  Instead of the main class 
 doing everything itself, it just calls on references to other classes and their methods, with those classes being specially designed to 
 be associated with one or two aspects of a project.  EX: The main class in a video-game about vampire-slaying will have a Monster, Weapon,
 and other related classes.
